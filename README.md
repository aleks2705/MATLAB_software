# MATLAB_software
The main purpose of this project was to develop a software, using MATLAB environment.

With my colleague, we decided to create a software to assist a gym manager in managing various datas related to his gym.

To make it possible, we first created an Excel spreadsheet with different informations about the gym's visitors. Next to this point, using this data, we made some graphics that provided insights such as inventory levels for snacks, the top three most loyal customers, and the average number of visitors per day and per week. These visualizations enable the gym manager to make informed decisions and optimize operations.
